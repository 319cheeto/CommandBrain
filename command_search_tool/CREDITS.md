# Credits & Acknowledgments

## Project Creator & Lead Developer
**Joshua Sears**  
- Original concept and vision
- Educational design and pedagogy
- Feature requirements and testing
- Student needs assessment
- Command database curation

## Development Process
This project was developed using **AI-assisted programming** with GitHub Copilot and Claude AI, which helped accelerate development while maintaining the creator's vision and educational goals.

## Philosophy
CommandBrain was created to solve a real problem: students in introductory cybersecurity and programming courses dropping out because Linux command-line tools felt overwhelming. The core innovation—**purpose-based search using student slang**—came from years of classroom experience and observing how students actually think about and search for tools.

## AI Assistance Acknowledgment
Like many modern software projects, CommandBrain utilized AI coding assistants during development for:
- Code implementation and optimization
- Documentation generation
- Security audit verification
- Bug fixes and error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

The educational design, feature requirements, and student-focused approach were entirely human-driven based on real classroom experience.

## Open Source Community
Special thanks to the open-source community for:
- Python and SQLite (the foundation)
- The cybersecurity education community
- Students who provided feedback and testing

## License
CommandBrain is released under the MIT License, making it freely available for educational use.
